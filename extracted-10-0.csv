"The special inspector shall verify that the fabricatormaintains detailed fabrication and quality controlprocedures that provide a basis for inspection controllof the workmanship and the fabricator's ability toconform to approved construction documents andreferenced standards.   The special  inspector shallreview the procedures for completeness and adequacyrelative to the code requirements for the fabricator'sscope of work..Excepttiion::  Special inspections shall not be requiredwhere the work is performed on the premises of afabricator that is enrolled in a nationally acceptedinspections program  acceptable to the registereddesign professional in charge.  At the completion offabrication,  the approved fabricator shall submit acertificate of compliance to the building official uponrequest and to the registered design professional inresponsible charge stating that the work was performedin accordance with the approved constructiondocuments..",,,
